# Data Types Practice

## Instructions

Imagine you are building a shopping cart. Write some documentation on the data types that you would need to complete your shopping experience. How did you arrive at your choices?
Numbers: give values to different data types
Arithmetic Operators; all arithmetic to happen. You can add different data types together.
Strings: they are characters that reside between single or doule quotes.
Booleans: They allow us to see if the boolean expression is true.
